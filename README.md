# Alice-Final-Project-James-Bond
University of Washington CSS 107 Class CSS 107: Introduction to Programming Through Animated Storytelling
Now that you have had some time to work in the Alice programming environment, it is time to apply your new knowledge of this programming environment.  You will be creating a short movie that will showcase your skills.  Have some fun with this assignment…get creative!

Assignment requirements:

Your movie must tell a story. 
Your grade for this project will have 4 parts:
Progress Reports: I'll meet with you in person in lieu of email progress reports.
Animation: Your animation grade will be determined using the following rubric.  In each grade category, you should consider the requirements as minimums.  Your success in completing these requirements and the quality of how you do so will determine where you land in that grade level.  Each subsequent grade level requires that you complete the requirements of the lower grade level, so to get a B grade you must also have included all that was asked for in the C grade level.
Challenge Summary: In addition to the creating the animation, you will write a short summary of challenges you faced in creating your animation as well as the solutions you chose and why.
Presentation: To begin your presentation you must talk about at least two of these challenges you faced when writing your story and what you did to “fix” them.  You will be assessing the animations of your classmates.  A part of this presentation grade will be determined by your classmates’ assessments.  In addition, you will receive credit for assessing others.
Length of animation: Your animations should be at least 30 seconds in length.  It should not exceed 3 minutes as we have a lot of animations to get through during the two days we will be presenting.
The last class before presentations, we will determine presentation order so  you should plan on attending that class.
All animations are due on the same day irrespective of when your actual class presentation date is.
